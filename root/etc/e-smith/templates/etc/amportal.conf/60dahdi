# If set to true, FreePBX will check if you have chan_dadhi installed. If so, it will
# automatically use all your ZAP configuration settings (devices and trunks) and
# silently convert them, under the covers, to DAHDI so no changes are needed. The
# GUI will continue to refer to these as ZAP but it will use the proper DAHDI channels.
# This will also keep Zap Channel DIDs working.
