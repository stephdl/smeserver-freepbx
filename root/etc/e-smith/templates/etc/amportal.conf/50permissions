# AMPVMUMASK: defaults to 077 allowing only the asterisk user to have any permissions on VM files. If set to something
#             like 007, it would allow the group to have permissions. This can be used if setting apache to a different
#             user then asterisk, so that the apache user (and thus ARI) can have access to read/write/delete the
#             voicemail files. If changed, some of the voicemail directory strucuters may have to be manually changed.
AMPVMUMASK=007
