# ENABLECW: Enable call waiting by default when an extension is created (DEFAULT is yes)
# Set to 'no' to if you don't want phones to be commissioned with call waiting already
# enabled. The user would then be required to dial the CW feature code (*70 default) to 
# enable their phone. Most installations should leave this alone. It allows multi-line
# phones to receive multiple calls on their line appearances.
ENABLECW=yes

#CWINUSEBUSY: Set to yes for extensions that have CW enabled to report as busy if
# they don't answer (resulting in busy voicemail greeting). Otherwise they simply
# report as no-answer (e.g. busy greeting servers no purpose
CWINUSEBUSY=yes

# AMPBADNUMBER: Set to false if you do not want the bad-number context generated which
# traps any bogus number or freature code and plays a message to the effect. If you use
# the Early Dial feature on some Grandstream phones, you will want to set this to false
AMPBADNUMBER=true

# If CUSTOMASERROR is set to false, then the Destination Registry will not report unknow destinations as errors
# this should be left to the default true and custom destinations should be moved into the new custom apps registry
# CUSTOMASERROR=false

# if DYNAMICHINTS is set to true, Core will not statically generate hints. Instead it will make a call to the
# AMPBIN php script, generate_hints.php, through an Asteirsk's #exec call. This requires Asterisk.conf to be
# configured with "execincludes=yes" set in the [options] section.
DYNAMICHINTS=false

# XTNCONFLICTABORT, BADDESTABORT
# setting either of these to true will result in retrieve_conf aborting during a reload if an extension
# conflict is detected or a destination is detected. It is usually better to allow the reload to go
# through and then correct the problem but these can be set if a more strict behavior is desired
# both default to false if not set
XTNCONFLICTABORT=false
BADDESTABORT=false

# USEDEVSTATE = true|false # DEFAULT VALUE false
# If this is set, it assumes that you are running Asterisk 1.4 or higher and want to take advantage of the
# func_devstate.c backport available from Asterisk 1.6 which allows custom hints to be created to support
# BLF for server side feature codes such as daynight, followme, etc.
#
USEDEVSTATE={ ( -e '/usr/lib/asterisk/modules/func_devstate.so' || 
		-e '/usr/lib64/asterisk/modules/func_devstate.so' )? 'true':'false';}

# MODULEADMINWGET=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE false
# Module Admin normally tries to get its online information through direct file open type calls to URLs that
# go back to the freepbx.org server. If it fails, typically because of content filters in firewalls that don't
# like the way PHP formats the requests, the code will fall back and try a wget to pull the information.
# This will often solve the problem. However, in such environemnts there can be a significant timeout before
# the failed file open calls to the URLs return and there are often 2-3 of these that occur. Setting this value
# will force FreePBX to avoid the attempt to open the URL and go straight to the wget calls.
#
MODULEADMINWGET=false

# AMPMPG123=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE true
# When set to false, the old MoH behavior is adopted where MP3 files can be loaded and WAV files converted to MP3
# The new default behavior assumes you have mpg123 loaded as well as sox and will convert MP3 files to WAV. This is
# highly recommended as MP3 files heavily tax the system and can cause instability on a busy phone system.
AMPMPG123={system('/usr/bin/which mpg123 > /dev/null 2>&1') == 0 ? 'true':'false';}
